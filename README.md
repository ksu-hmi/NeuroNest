**Background**

My dedication to neurodiversity is rooted in personal experience, as an individual with ADHD. As a mother of an Autistic child, I also have a deep-seated passion for advocacy. Through this project, I aim to develop innovative solutions that foster inclusivity and support for neurodivergent individuals in the workplace. I hope to employ this app at job upon completion. Together, we can create environments where everyone has the opportunity to flourish.
